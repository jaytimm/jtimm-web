So, I planted a mixture of native grasses and wildflowers.  The former is comprised of 12 warm-season grasses; the latter a collection of 18 southwest annuals/perennials.  Things grow for sure.  But I don't know what is what, or what is weed.  \n\nI wanted an online reference guide specific to the 30 species of wildflower and grass in my meadow. And I wanted to build this programmatically, using a single block of code, based on a simple table of scientific/common names.  While also having a table of contents, headers, etc in `quarto`.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Meadow\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf |> DT::datatable(df, rownames = F)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-f84fcfad370989fcff9b\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\" class=\"datatables html-widget\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-f84fcfad370989fcff9b\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"data\":[[\"Coreopsis tinctoria\",\"Eschscholzia\",\"Eschscholzia mexicana\",\"Gaillardia pulchella\",\"Gilia tricolor\",\"Linum perenne lewisii\",\"Layia platyglossa\",\"Lupinus arizonicus\",\"Lupinus succulentus\",\"Mentzelia lindleyi\",\"Nemophila maculata\",\"Oenothera pallida\",\"Oenothera speciosa\",\"Phacelia campanularia\",\"Ratibida columnifera\",\"Aster tanacetifolius\",\"Baileya multiradiata\",\"Clarkia unguiculata\",\"Bouteloua gracilis\",\"Schizachyrium scoparium\",\"Achnatherum hymenoides\",\"Bouteloua curtipendula\",\"Hilaria jamesii\",\"Sporobolus airoides\",\"Pascopyrum smithii\",\"Sporobolus cryptandrus\",\"Buchloe dactyloides\",\"Festuca ovina\",\"Nassella viridula\",\"Lolium perenne\"],[\"Plains Coreopsis\",\"California Poppy\",\"Mexican Gold Poppy\",\"Indian Blanket\",\"Bird's Eyes\",\"Blue Flax\",\"Tidy Tips\",\"Arizona Lupine\",\"Arroyo Lupine\",\"Blazing Star\",\"Five Spot\",\"White Evening Primrose\",\"Showy Pink Evening Primrose\",\"California Bluebell\",\"Mexican Hat\",\"Prairie Aster\",\"Desert Marigold\",\"Farewell to Spring\",\"Blue grama, Hachita\",\"Little bluestem\",\"Indian Ricegrass\",\"Sideoats grama, El Reno\",\"Galleta, Viva\",\"Alkali sacaton, VNS\",\"Western wheatgrass, Arriba\",\"Sand dropseed, VNS\",\"Buffalo grass, Texoka\",\"Sheep fescue, Covar\",\"Green needlegrass, Lodorm\",\"Perennial ryegrass, Linn\"],[\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\"]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th>scientific<\\/th>\\n      <th>common<\\/th>\\n      <th>type<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"scientific\":[\"Coreopsis tinctoria\",\"Eschscholzia\",\"Eschscholzia mexicana\",\"Gaillardia pulchella\",\"Gilia tricolor\",\"Linum perenne lewisii\",\"Layia platyglossa\",\"Lupinus arizonicus\",\"Lupinus succulentus\",\"Mentzelia lindleyi\",\"Nemophila maculata\",\"Oenothera pallida\",\"Oenothera speciosa\",\"Phacelia campanularia\",\"Ratibida columnifera\",\"Aster tanacetifolius\",\"Baileya multiradiata\",\"Clarkia unguiculata\",\"Bouteloua gracilis\",\"Schizachyrium scoparium\",\"Achnatherum hymenoides\",\"Bouteloua curtipendula\",\"Hilaria jamesii\",\"Sporobolus airoides\",\"Pascopyrum smithii\",\"Sporobolus cryptandrus\",\"Buchloe dactyloides\",\"Festuca ovina\",\"Nassella viridula\",\"Lolium perenne\"],\"common\":[\"Plains Coreopsis\",\"California Poppy\",\"Mexican Gold Poppy\",\"Indian Blanket\",\"Bird's Eyes\",\"Blue Flax\",\"Tidy Tips\",\"Arizona Lupine\",\"Arroyo Lupine\",\"Blazing Star\",\"Five Spot\",\"White Evening Primrose\",\"Showy Pink Evening Primrose\",\"California Bluebell\",\"Mexican Hat\",\"Prairie Aster\",\"Desert Marigold\",\"Farewell to Spring\",\"Blue grama, Hachita\",\"Little bluestem\",\"Indian Ricegrass\",\"Sideoats grama, El Reno\",\"Galleta, Viva\",\"Alkali sacaton, VNS\",\"Western wheatgrass, Arriba\",\"Sand dropseed, VNS\",\"Buffalo grass, Texoka\",\"Sheep fescue, Covar\",\"Green needlegrass, Lodorm\",\"Perennial ryegrass, Linn\"],\"type\":[\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"flower\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\",\"grass\"],\"columnDefs\":[],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Building guide\n\nProcess: \n\n(1) Collect photos for each genus/species from Google using the `photomoe` package;\n\n(2) collect a sentence or two of species description from Wikipedia using the `quicknews` package; and\n\n\n(3) output everything in one fell swoop.\n\n\nThe code below is for the wildflower section; we do the same thing again for grasses.
