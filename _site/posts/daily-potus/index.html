<p>The two functions are at work below. The <code>daily_wiki_trump</code> returns a table of executive branch happenings from 20 Jan 2017 to 20 Jan 2021. The <code>daily_wiki_biden</code> function returns an up-to-date (and identically structured) table for the ongoing Biden Presidency.</p>

<p>For demonstration, we calculate total word counts of event descriptions per day. The plot below, then, summarizes these daily word counts since Jan 2017. The plot itself is fairly meaningless, but the hover-action should be useful (to contextualize other data points, eg). For clarity purposes, only the first event for each day is included in the pop-up.</p>
