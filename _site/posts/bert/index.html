<p>This post provides some quick details on using <code>reticulate</code> to interface Python from RStudio; and, more specifically, using the <code>spacy</code> library and BERT for fine-grained lexical semantic investigation. Here we present a (very cursory) usage-based/BERT-based perspective on the semantic distinction between <code>further</code> and <code>farther</code>, using example contexts extracted from the <a href="https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/">Corpus of Contemporary American English</a> (COCA).</p>

<p>The Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) is an absolutely lovely resource, and is one of <a href="https://www.english-corpora.org/">many corpora</a> made available by the folks at BYU. Here, we utilize COCA to build a simple data set of <code>further</code>-<code>farther</code> example usages. I have copied/pasted from COCA’s online search interface – the data set includes ~500 contexts of usage per form.</p>

<p>Using BERT and <code>spacy</code> for computing contextual word embeddings is actually fairly straightforward. A very nice resource for some theoretical overview as well as code demo with BERT/spacy is available <a href="https://applied-language-technology.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/part_iii/04_embeddings_continued.html#visualising-word-embeddings">here</a>.</p>
<p>Getting started, we pass our data set from R to Python via the <code>r_to_py</code> function.</p>

</div>
<p>Then, from a Python console, we load the BERT transformer using <code>spacy</code>.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>The stretch of Python code below does all the work here</strong>. The transformer computes a 768 dimension vector per token/sub-token comprising each context – then we extract the tensor for either <code>further</code>/<code>farther</code> using the token index. The resulting data structure is matrix-like, with each instantiation of <code>further</code>-<code>farther</code> represented in 768 dimensions.</p>

<p>To plot these contexts in two dimensions, we use tSNE to reduce the 768-dimension word embeddings to two. Via Python and <code>numpy</code>, we create a matrix-proper from the <code>further</code>-<code>farther</code> token embeddings extracted above.</p>

<p>The scatter plot below summarizes contextual embeddings for individual tokens of <code>further</code>-<code>farther</code>. So, a nice space for <code>further</code> used adjectivally on the right side of the plot. Other spaces less obviously structured, and some confused spaces as well where speakers seem to have quite a bit of leeway.</p>
